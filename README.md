Problem 1:

Program for following:
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. 
For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for 
"abcabcbb" is "abc", for which the length is 3. 
For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1
Note: You can choose a programming language of your own choice.

please open main branch and this path : 
src/main/java/com/example/LongestString.java


problem 2:
Assume there is a website https://agrichain.com which does exactly the 
same thing as problem 1, it takes the input on home page and then on 
click of submit button, it navigates to different page where it prints
the output for longest substring without repeating letters.

I have implemented all the necessarry steps to do automation work and refer this 
task inside test/java/tests/StringAutomation.java

I also implemented feature file for this so you will find one substring.feature file
as well to run this test and another way would be testng.xml


Write alltest cases you would be doing to test the above website. 
Categorise those cases in manual (you would be doing manually) 
and automation (you would be automating).
Write web automation script for any one test case that you have 
mentioned above with high level automation framework(folder/directory structure) 
to explain which goes where (browser initialisation, web elements, test scenario etc).


I have written all the testcases inside testcases.feature file.
This is not exactly feature file but just wanted to make easier to read all 
the things in one place.
